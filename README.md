**DESCRIPTION** :
The chat server and client program you have is a simple Java-based messaging system where multiple clients can connect to a server and exchange messages in real-time. The server listens for incoming connections on a specified port, accepts multiple client connections, and manages message broadcasting to all connected clients. Each client runs as a separate thread, allowing multiple users to communicate simultaneously. The client connects to the server, sends messages, and receives messages from other users through the server. The system ensures real-time interaction by continuously listening for messages and displaying them on each connected clientâ€™s console. This setup forms the foundation of a basic multi-user chat application.
